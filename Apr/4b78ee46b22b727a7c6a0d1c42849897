 It's the only standard issue bazooka that the US Army gives its weapons.  The above photo is of an 82nd Airborne Division paratrooper, Spc. Michael Tagalog, firing an 84mm Carl Gustaf recoilless rifle from an observation post in Afghanistan's Nangahar Province in September 2017. The specialist apparently fired the Multi-Role Anti-Armor, Anti-Personnel Weapons System (MAAWS), or Carl Gustaf, in defense of a US base in Afghanistan. Originally used by special operators, the US Army began issuing the Gustaf to soldiers in 1991 in response to an Operational Needs Statement from Afghanistan. The Saab-made bazooka is 42 inches long, weighs about 25 pounds and can hit targets from 1,300 meters away, according to army-technology.com. It fires a variety of munitions, including high explosive anti-tank, high explosive dual purpose and high explosive rounds. The Gustaf can even fire smoke and illumination rounds. Army and industry weapons developers are also currently working with the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency to develop a guided-munitions round for the Gustaf. The US is quietly ramping up the nearly 17-year war in Afghanistan that has been criticized by many as a "forever war" and a game of "whack-a-mole."
