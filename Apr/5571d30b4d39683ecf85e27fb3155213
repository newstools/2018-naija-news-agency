On Sunday, April 1, 2018, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu announced the housemate as the latest to exit the house. His eviction  comes a day after Bambam's shocking eviction. Teddy A was up for possible eviction alongside Cee-C and Nina.  Ebuka got to chat with Bambam, who was shockingly evicted the previous day. She talked about her plans to feature in Nollywood movies. On her relationship with Teddy, she said she was going to give him time to settle with his woman, and wouldn't force anything between them. When asked who she thought would win the game, she said she wasn't sure, but that it looked like Miracle would emerge the winner.  Following Teddy A's eviction, he had a brief chat with Ebuka. He told Ebuka that while his initial plan was to flirt with all the ladies in the house, Bambam happened. He also said he wasn't surprised about the housemates – including Rico – who nominated him for possible eviction.  The turf war made it seem difficult for the Housemates to maneuver freely, but at the end it all bore fruit. The Housemates won their wager and shopping will commence soon.        There are currently 9 contestants battling for the 45 million naira grand prize. With 63 days gone, the housemates have 22 more days to spend in the Big Brother Naija house.
