 The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia last week held its first Arab Fashion in moves seen as efforts by Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, the kingdom’s de-facto leader, to help improve the country’s global image and attract foreign investors. Designers such as Roberto Cavalli and Jena Paul Gaultier along with other local designers graced the event which ran from April 10-14, kicking off with an opening ceremony on Tuesday and held at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh.  Saudi Arabia is known for its conservative laws and it was no surprise that men and photographers were not allowed in the audience and photos that were taken by organisers had to be cleared by government censors before publication.  Parts of the restrictions guiding the event also provided that no cleavage, nothing above the knee and nothing too transparent were allowed at the Riyadh show.  Layla Issa Abuzaid, country director for Saudi Arabia at the Arab Fashion Council, had earlier said when the project was announced: “The first Arab Fashion Week in Riyadh will be more than a world-class event. It is a catalyst through which we believe the fashion sector will lead other economic sectors such as tourism, hospitality, travel and trade.” The post Saudi Arabia Holds First Arab Fashion Week But Men Were Not Allowed In The Audience appeared first on Nigerian Entertainment Today.
