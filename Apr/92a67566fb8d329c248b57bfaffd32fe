A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)  is expected to be signed between the Kano state government and the World Bank towards making accessibility to the rural areas. The World Bank will be constructing road networks of about 500km across the 44 local governments in Kano State, Nigeria. Already, the global bank  has reached an advanced stage to construct the road networks in the state under Rural Access and Agricultural Marketing Project (RAAMP). A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)  is expected to be signed between the Kano state government and the World Bank towards making accessibility to the rural areas. Speaking on the move, the Kano state commissioner for Rural and Community Development, Alhaji Musa Iliyasu Kwankwaso said that because of the importance attached to rural roads by the state government, the World Bank decided to construct about 500km roads across the 44 local governments. The state commissioner also noted that the state government led Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje came up with a Rural Access Mobility Directorate, so as to strengthen compliance with global best practices in rural development.  With the RAAMP intervention, which is to be funded by Kano state and the World Bank, each of the 44 local governments in the state would get at least 10km road. Recently, Governor Ganduje was on an inspection tour of the 15km Magami-Birnin Bako road, in Sumaila local government. During the inspection tour, the Governor assured people of his administration's commitment to the development of rural communities saying, "We are extremely happy with the level of work done, its quality and how people are showing their enthusiasm for the project. That sense of ownership from the part of the communities is also there." Finance: The World Bank will be constructing 500km roads across the 44 LGs in Kano
