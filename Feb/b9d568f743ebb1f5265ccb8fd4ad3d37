 Dear Bukky, I discovered some changes in my girlfriend's behaviour since December. Recently out of curiosity I decided to go through her phone, only to discover that she has been texting a guy. They are actually sending I love you to each other. This is a guy she confessed to her friend she's catching feelings for according to an earlier message. What should I do?__________________ Dear reader, The writing might seem clear enough on the wall that you should dump her and you probably might, bit first I want you to look at this from another angle. Did you know that being in a relationship does not stop you from catching feelings for other people? It is an idea that many people don't like to admit but it is true and it really does happen, as this insightful Pulse article will reveal to you. In that article above which you totally have to read, we examined this type of situation and advised that while the feelings will come and attraction to other people will be fired up, it does not have to be the end of one's present relationship. If those emotions are properly managed [suppressed], one gets to know in the end that grass is not always greener on the other side. In essence, your girlfriend might have a supposed thing for another guy right now but it could be a phase rather than something permanent. I understand that leaving her will be the first option you'll naturally consider first but consider this alternate possibility I just exposed you to above and in the suggested article. Maybe give it a little time and see how things pan out. I'd suggest you also become a better partner as much as is reasonable. This is to gauge if it is a lack of attention from you that pushed her into that other guy's arms. If that other relationship continues fester after this, then maybe she's truly hopelessly and irredeemably gone._______________Do you want to talk about your love life, marriage or family issues?
