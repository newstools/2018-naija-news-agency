He said this is to show the daily plan resonates with the income level of the majority of Nigerians. “Our Subscriber base continues to soar fast and statistics have revealed that most of our new subscribers come in asking to be placed on the pay per day plan, which is the latest package that allows you pay only for the number of days you wish to watch.” He added that: “Being the only pay TV operator that offers daily subscription package, it is not surprising that this has been in our favour as most people no longer want to pay for TV subscription they hardly watch.” The company is the only pay-Tv operator offering daily viewing plan in Nigeria.
