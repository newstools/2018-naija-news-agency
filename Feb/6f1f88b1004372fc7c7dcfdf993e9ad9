By Chidi Nkwopara OWERRI—THE Vice Chancellor, VC, of Federal University of Technology, Owerri, FUTO, Professor Francis C. Eze, has raised alarm that land speculators have destroyed the master plan of the institution. Professor Eze, who raised the alarm while addressing journalists yesterday, also expressed grief that fresh buildings were still going on. “The encroachment on FUTO land is overwhelming that management now prefers to call it serious invasion. The illegal structures erected by these equally illegal developers, have destroyed the master plan of the University”, Eze said. While recalling that FUTO land was acquired legitimately and full compensation paid to the land owners, the VC however expressed regret that only a few people within the host communities ganged up, for pecuniary reasons and sold parts of the University land. “Site for the erection of hostel facilities have been sadly built up by these intruders,” he lamented.
