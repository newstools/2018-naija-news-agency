 Cee C gets into a fight with Ifu, Tobi tells Cee C she's always wrong, the housemates choose their favourite pair: Here's a recap of #BBNaija day 26. Check out a recap of day 26, including social media reactions. After winning the Wager and the Head of House title, Miracle landed another victory during the Arena Games. During the arena games, Biggies asked the housemates to solve five challenges in a record ten minutes. Biggie had designed the Game for Housemates to make the best use of speed, agility and balance under pressure. Miracle emerged the winner and can't wait to see what Biggie's reward for him is today.   After Ifu said Alex's bum and hips are bigger than Cee C's, the two got into a fight. Cee C told Ifu she had 'comparing issues' and is the least person with the right to criticize her. Perhaps, Cee C was angry because she has a problem with Alex's closeness to her former partner and love interest, Tobi. Also, the comparison was made in front of Tobi, who neither took side with Cee C nor try to calm her down.    As is often the norm, Cee C expected Tobi to contribute or take sides with her during her fight with Ifu. Surprisingly, Tobi told her that she was wrong about the whole thing. He also asked that they become just friends since he can't make any impact in her life.         Biggie asked the housemates to come up with the names of their two preferred Pairs. Here's how they voted: Tobi from the Tolex (Tobi and Alex) pair chose Mito (Miracle and Anto) and Tena (Teddy A and Nina) Lolu and Cee C chose Mito (Miracle and Anto) and Bamco (Bambam and Rico) Miracle and Anto chose Bamco and Gelah (Angel and Ahneeka) Nina and Teddy chose Tolex and Gelah. Rico and Bambam chose Gelah and Tena Leo and Ifu chose Bamco and Tena Tena picked Tolex and Gelah Ahneeka and Angel chose Tena and Mito. Biggie informed them that the results would only be made known after the live Eviction show. What was your favourite part of Big Brother Naija day 26?
