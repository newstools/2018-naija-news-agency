 For Bishop Sam Zuga, Christians and Christianity in general is Nigeria's problem. The General overseer of House of Joy Ministry in Benue state made this startling announcement on his Facebook page. In his post on February 26, 2018, which can be seen below, he gives several reasons why he thinks Muslims are better than Christians. This post got the following comments from Facebook users: One person wrote, “Oga Muslim preacher, you forgot to add that all the terrorist organizations in the world are Muslims. You Praise the source terror and enemies of peace, you are worse than them. Jesus said…no one sees the father except by me. Repent fake Bishop or Perish!!!” Another said, “You see your life. How can you publish such rubbish.” “Like it or not Islam is the only true religion on the face of this earth!!!!!!!!!!!!!,” a supporter wrote. ALSO READ: Throwback to when Muslims and Christians used to live peacefully in Jerusalem Today, February 27, 2018, the G.O shared two more posts supporting his initial statement. The first was a longer explanation of Christianity and why Christians are really the problem in this country. Bishop Zuga wrote: The second post was his reaction to the mean comments, gotten from the first two posts. In capital letters, he wrote, “TRUTH DON’T NEED TO BE ACCEPTED, TRUTH DON’T NEED TO BE CELEBRATED, TRUTH DON’T NEED TO BE APPRECIATED. TRUTH ONLY NEED TO BE TOLD.” The G.O is no stranger to controversy. In 2016, he was faced with allegations that his miracle was fake. He responded by using buckets of water, which he turned to medicine, to heal several people. Bishop Sam Zuga: Popular pastor says Muslims are better than Christians
