By Oboh Agbonkhese The immediate past Chairman of Police Community Relations Committee, PCRC, Enerhen Police Division, under Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta State, Chief Samuel Brigue, has dragged the Divisional Police Officer, DPO, of the Division, DSP Emmanuel Yakubu, to court on allegations of defamation of character and threat to his life.  Also, in a petition to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, Chief Brigue, who had served in PCRC in various capacities since 1991, queried what he described as unlawful dissolution of the PCRC and urged the governor to intervene and save his life. According to Brigue, since the misunderstanding between him and the DPO started, several attempts have been made on his life. Brigue disclosed that he was being persecuted and prosecuted by the Police over alleged traffic offence of non-possession of valid vehicle particulars, which, he said, was not true, adding that DSP Yakubu was out to silence him and wrongfully profile him before his people. DPO’s reaction However, contacted on phone, DSP Emmanuel Yakubu declined comment, saying the matter is already before the court. The three cases in court include the one bordering on defamation of character before High Court 1, Otor-Udu billed for hearing yesterday; unlawful dissolution of Enerhen PCRC, for hearing in March before the High Court 1, and the third bordering on threats to life, threats to arrest and imprison and breach of his fundamental human rights, billed for judgment on April 10. Meanwhile, a source that spoke on grounds of anonymity, told Vanguard: “The former PCRC boss is just not wise. He has petitioned the Area Commander, Assistant Inspector-General of Police and the Inspector-General. “He was running a parallel Police outfit. He has no case. Besides, he was arrested for a traffic offence.” The post Ex-PCRC chair takes DPO to court, alleges threat to life
