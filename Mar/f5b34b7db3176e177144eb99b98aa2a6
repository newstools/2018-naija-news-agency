 The LA Stadium will host Chargers and Rams games and comes with retail and residential space. In 2020, the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers hope to share a stadium in Inglewood, California. The LA Stadium, which will house both teams, is a massive, sprawling $2.6 billion project that will host year-round sports and entertainment events. It's also slated to host the opening and closing ceremonies for the 2028 Olympics in L.A.
