 He said the president did not know about the absence of the IGP in Benue because he doesn't get every information. The president's spokesperson was reacting to the public outrage that has trailed the president's public admission that he was ignorant of the fact that the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, had not carried out his order to relocate to Benue State to stem the spate of violent attacks carried out by cattle herders. In a report by Premium Times, Adesina responded to the public reaction that had trailed the admission while appearing on a RayPower FM public affairs programme, Political Platform, on Tuesday, March 13, 2018. Adesina said the president did not know about the absence of the IGP in Benue because he doesn't get every information. He said, "It just tells you that the president is not omniscient. As president and commander-in-chief, he has other channels, but it doesn't mean that he gets every information under the sun."
