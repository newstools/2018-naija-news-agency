 Ross was reportedly treated using a procedure called ECMO – a technique used to oxygenate his blood outside of his body before it's pumped back into his body. TMZ reports that the 42-year-old Maybach Music Group (MMG) boss was hooked up to a machine that is performing the functions of his heart and lungs. He is said to be currently getting treatment in the cardiatric unit. The procedure was described as ECMO, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation – a technique used to oxygenate his blood outside of his body before it's pumped back into his body. It was reported on Friday that someone from the rapper's home called 911 to report Ross' situation – he was said to be breathing heavily and unresponsive on Thursday morning. However, a rapper Fat Trel who is signed to Ross'  label debunked the report that he is on life support. "JUS TALKED 2 MY BIG HOMIE… HE GOOD… HE IN DA HOSPITAL BUT HE IS NOT ON “LIFE SUPPORT” … HE GOOD," Trel wrote on Instagram. But in a follow-up event, TMZ reported, with a supposed photo proof, that Rick Ross' family raced to the hospital when they learnt his condition had worsened. According to the report, one of Ross' baby mamas and several companions poured into a white Rolls-Royce and raced it to the hospital near Miami. They were said to have forgotten to shut the car doors after they arrived at the hospital due to their "mad rush". Business mogul, Sean Combs popularly known as Diddy also took to Instagram to solicit for prayers for Rick Ross.  Rick Ross: Panic as ailing US rapper is reportedly put on life support
