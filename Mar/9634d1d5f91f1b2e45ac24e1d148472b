 The Hamptons is home to celebrities, hedge fund managers, CEOs, socialites, and politicians. Here's the median asking price of houses for sale there right now. The Hamptons is the preeminent summer vacation destination in the tri-state area. The Hamptons encompasses more than two dozen villages and hamlets on Long Island. While people live there year-round, it's the months between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day weekend each year when visitors infuse the Hamptons with energy â€” and money. The Hamptons is hallmarked by its countless famous and flush residents, including hedge fund managers, celebrities, CEOs, and socialites. Bill and Hillary Clinton have long vacationed on Georgica Beach in East Hampton. And Southampton even has its very own "Billionaire Lane" reserved for the rich and powerful. Such prestige doesn't come cheap. At least seven towns in the Hamptons have a median home listing price of around $1 million. That means half the houses for sale in those places are priced under seven figures, and half are priced above. What's more, at least 11 towns have median home prices between $2.2 million to $5.6 million. That's according to StreetEasy, which recently launched a new Hamptons platform, Out East, for sale and rental listings in the Hamptons.
