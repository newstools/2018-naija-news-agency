 The Emirates flight attendant was preparing the plane for a flight to Dubai when she fell.  An Emirates Airline flight attendant died on Wednesday after falling out of a plane while it was parked at the gate in Entebbe, Uganda before a flight. The female flight attendant was rushed to a nearby hospital alive with injuries to her face and knees but died soon after, the BBC reported. The details surrounding the fall are unclear at this point and the Ugandan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has launched an investigation into the incident. However, the CAA did say in a statement that it appeared the Emirates flight attendant opened the emergency door before falling out. "Our thoughts and prayers are with her family, and we’re providing them with all possible support and care," an Emirates spokeswoman said in a statement to Business Insider. "We will extend our full co-operation to the authorities in their investigation." The incident occurred on March 14 at Entebbe International Airport as the Emirates crew prepared Flight EK730, a Boeing 777-300ER, for boarding. The Emirates flight to Dubai, United Arab Emirates was delayed for roughly an hour as a result of the fall. Here is the Emirates statement in its entirety: "We can confirm that a member of our cabin crew fell from an open door while preparing the aircraft for boarding on flight EK730 from Entebbe on 14 March 2018. The injured crew member was brought to the hospital but unfortunately succumbed to her injuries. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family, and we’re providing them with all possible support and care. We will extend our full co-operation to the authorities in their investigation."
