 Musa scored for CSKA Moscow on Thursday to ensure qualification to the quarter-finals. The quarter-final draws were made on Friday, March 16 less than 24 hours after Musa scored in CSKA Moscow’s 3-2 win over Lyon to ensure qualification for the quarter-finals. With the score 1-1 and Lyon still leading 2-1 on aggregate, Musa netted in the 59th minute, getting on to a low cross from the right to finish past the goalkeeper.  The Nigeria international was impressive in the game and could have scored earlier from a couple of chances. For the quarter-finals, CSKA Moscow will now face Premier League giants Arsenal. CSKA Moscow will first travel to London to face Arsenal on Thursday, April 5 with the return leg a week later in Russia.

He wasn’t listed when Arsenal beat Leicester City 4-3 in the Premier League opener of the 2017-2018 season.
