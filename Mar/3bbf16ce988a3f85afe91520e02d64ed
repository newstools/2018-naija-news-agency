 Everything seems just fine between us except this age difference. Dear Bukky, I'm 28 years old and 3 years older than my guy, but he loves me sincerely and treats me right. However this age gap keeps me worried. Please I need your advice._____________ Dear reader, All that one needs in a partner is to be treated with the right amount of respect and care, things your your boyfriend apparently gives you in reasonably measures. I understand the worry and concern about the age difference given the kind of society we are in. But I assure you that age is really nothing but a number. ALSO READ: My mum says I can't date my boyfriend because he's younger If that man is good to you, you really have nothing to worry about. Leave society's standard and do what makes you happy. That's what's most important. On the other hand, if you somehow can't get over the age gap, I think it's fair to let him know on time. It won't be nice to have him investing all that emotional energy into a relationship that's already cut off from your mind.______________Do you want to talk about your love life, marriage or family issues?
