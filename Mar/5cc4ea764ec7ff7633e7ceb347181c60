 One week after, and we still can't get over how exquisite Fateema Ganduje looked on her wedding day! Fatima is the daughter of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano while her groom [now husband] is the son of Governor Abiola Ajimobi of Oyo State respectively and their wonderful, highbrow ceremony showed all that high-powered glamour as several politicians and huge society people graced the occasion which took place in Kano State.
