 The PDP chieftain asked the court to grant him permission to travel abroad for medical treatment. During proceedings, Metuh's counsel, Emeka Etiaba (SAN), asked the court that his client be allowed to travel to the United Kingdom to seek adequate medical treatment for his worsening health. He presented a letter from one Dr. Adrian T.H. Kasey, a neurosurgeon at Wellington Hospital in London, who said Metuh needs to be treated urgently. The PDP chieftain had been forced to make his last court appearance on a stretcher as he was brought in an ambulance in a bid to heed Justice Okon Abang's directive to show up in court or have his bail revoked. His lawyer, Onyeachi Ikpeazu (SAN), told the court that he was on admission at the Nnamdi Azikwe University Teaching Hospital for an undisclosed ailment. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is prosecuting Metuh and his company, Destra Investments Limited, on a seven-count charge bordering on fraud and money laundering. The alleged offence involved $2 million and N400 million which the defendant allegedly received from the office of then-National Security Adviser (NSA), Sambo Dasuki, in 2014. While the money was earmarked "for security services" in the exhibits presented to the court, Metuh allegedly spent it on the party and personal affairs.
