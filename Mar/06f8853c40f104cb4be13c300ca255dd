Known for her book "Children of Blood and Bone", the first in a trilogy to be published by Macmillan Children’s Publishing Group, Adeyemi graduated from Harvard with an honours degree in English Literature, she then received a fellowship that allowed her to study West African mythology and culture in Salvador, Brazil. Adeyemi has said she wanted to write a fantasy novel set in West Africa so that "a little Black girl could pick up my book one day and see herself as the star…I want her to know that she’s beautiful and she matters and she can have a crazy, magical adventure even if an ignorant part of the world tells her she can never be Hermione Granger." The "Children of Blood and Bone" movie is in development at Fox 2000/Temple Hill Productions with Karen Rosenfelt and Wyck Godfrey (Twilight, Maze Runner, The Fault In Our Stars) producing it. According to her website, when she’s not working on her novels or watching "Scandal", she spends her time blogging and teaching creative writing to her subscribers. Her website has even been named one of the 101 best websites for writers by Writer’s Digest. Tomi Adeyemi: All you need to know about award-winning writer
