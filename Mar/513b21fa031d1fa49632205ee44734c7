For over a decade, the NIKE Foundation, inspired by Nikeâ€™s belief in human potential, has been focused on investing in girls. In 2008 the NIKE Foundation, in collaboration with NoVo Foundation, United Nations Foundation and other partners, launched the Girl Effect movement. With the support of over 150 partners in 90 countries, NIKE Foundation and the Girl Effect movement have positively impacted the lives of millions of girls and influenced investment in them. Girl Effect is now a new organisation, with continued support from the NIKE Foundation and multiple partners. The organisation works at scale and drives forward the ambition to reach 250 million girls living in poverty across the world by 2030, giving them the tools and access to the critical assets they need to achieve their full potential.
