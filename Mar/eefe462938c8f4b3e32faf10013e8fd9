 It is not known if Ushbebe was actually joking or meant it when he called DJ Cuppy a wack DJ. The comedian made this known over the weekend during his yearly comedy show which was held in Lagos. In a short video released the comedian made both his comments which received a lot of laughter from the guest "And that Otedola daughter she nor sabi play nothing. She is a wack DJ," he said. Anyway, we don't really know if he was just entertaining his fans or if he actually meant it. Even if he was joking, maybe he just went overboard with the joke.  Even though DJ Cuppy hasn't said anything concerning this latest development, we know she might just push this one aside as comments like this usually don't get to her. Just recently, DJ Cuppy announced that she would be sending ten students through university on a full scholarship which was greatly applauded by fans and admirers.  The beautiful Daughter of billionaire businessman, Femi Otedola was recently spotted with boyfriend, Asa Asika in a bedroom photo which shows how deeply these guys are into each other.  Speculations of the relationship between these guys have been around for a while as we can all recall when photos of DJ Cuppy and Asa at a beach somewhere in South Africa went viral, making fans and admirers wonder if they had kicked off a romantic affair.  It was reported the couple traveled to South Africa on vacation and the picture was shared by a third party which then went viral. This is not the first time that these guys have speculated about their relationship. DJ Cuppy: Ushbebe calls disc jockey wack! (Video)
