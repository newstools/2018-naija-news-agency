Abraham famously denied a formal approach from Nigeria through the president of the Nigeria Football Federation ( NFF) Amaju Pinnick, who even claimed productive talks were held with the England Youth international. The Anglo-Nigerian went ahead to make his debut for England during the last round of international games, and afterwards said he has always wanted to play for England despite the overtures from Nigeria. However, despite earning praises for his performances in the games against Germany and Brazil respectively, the on loan Chelsea forward failed to make the list for their upcoming international engagement later in the month.
