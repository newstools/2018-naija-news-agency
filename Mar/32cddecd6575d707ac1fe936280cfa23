 Please I want to know if it’s cheating when your partner has Facebook lovers. Dear Bukky, Please I want to know if it’s cheating when your partner has Facebook lovers. Is that enough reason to believe they do not love you? And does it make sense to end the relationship for this reason?_________________ Dear reader, Having another lover anywhere is cheating – whether it is in real life or in a virtual space. Relationships and marriages have begun off social media, so never accept the excuse that the relationship is not real because it’s happening on social media. Love is a tricky thing and many truly believe that you can love more than one person at a time. But while I’m not sure if she still loves you, I’m sure that she’s not doing right by you if she’s truly encouraging amorous messages and relations on Facebook. It’s enough reason to break up, to be sincere. If someone constantly neglects your wishes and cares not how their behaviour negatively affects you, I think it’s OK to break up. Having a partner on social media and refusing to stop is enough justification for letting that woman or man go._________________Do you want to talk about your love life, marriage or family issues?
