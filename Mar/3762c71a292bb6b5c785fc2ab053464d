 23-time Grand Slam singles tennis champion Serena Williams has an interesting diet plan — here's everything she eats in a typical day.  Serena Williams returns to the Women's Tennis Association Tour at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, this week. The comeback marks the first time she'll contest an official singles tour match since the 2017 Australian Open — a tournament she won whilst pregnant. Williams took the rest of the year off, gave birth to her daughter Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., but is now ready to pick up where she left off. In order to maintain her sporting dominance, Williams has to eat right before a match. So what sort of food does a 23-time tennis major champion serve up? Here's everything Williams likes to have for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Source: Glamour.         Source: Facebook.   Source: Glamour.   Source: Bon Appetit.   Source: Bon Appetit.
