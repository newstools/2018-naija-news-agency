 Buhari is, however, being criticised for attending the wedding of governors' kids but failed to visit Yobe, where 110 girls were kidnapped. The couple, Fatima Ganduje and Idris Ajimobi – daughter and son of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano and Abiola Ajimobi of Oyo State respectively – are tying the knots on Saturday, March 3, 2018.  The President's Special Assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmad shared the information on Twitter. Some critics, however, berated Buhari for attending the wedding of governors' kids but failed to visit Dapchi, Yobe state, where 110 girls were recently kidnapped by the Boko Haram insurgents. The Special Adviser on New Media to the Kano State Government, Salihu Tanko Yakasai, also tweeted photos from the heavy-weight wedding.    According to him, Buhari was the Guardian to the bride, Fatima, while APC National leader Asiwaju Bola Tinubu was the guardian to the groom, Idris, at the wedding. The sum of N50,000 was paid as Fatima's dowry.  He had also been criticised for being insensitive to the plights of the people of Benue, where over 100 people were massacred by Fulani herdsmen since the wake of a new year.
