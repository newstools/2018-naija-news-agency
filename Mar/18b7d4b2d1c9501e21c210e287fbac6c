Biggie summed up the conversation as a conspiracy. That, plus the ignored summon resulted to two strikes for Tobi. The housemates wagered 100% this week. They were asked to create an interesting musical for their Wager Finale. The theme for the week was 'Silly' and Biggie said he was entertained as he announced that they had won their wager. Tobi and Rico were announced as winners of the Nokia Task. They have won 2 million naira, the Nokia 8 Bothie phones and shopping vouchers.  There's a clip of Miracle and Nina allegedly having sex after the eviction show. The video is not explicit, so it's unclear what happened beneath the sheets. What was your favourite part of the day?
