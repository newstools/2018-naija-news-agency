 Tyronne Ebuehi was in action as ADO Den Haag lost to NAC Breda Ebuehi who is part of the 28 players invited by Gernot Rohr for the friendlies scheduled for March, was in action from the start against compatriot Umar Sadiq who was included in the team of the league for the last round of matches. The 22-year-old who stated that he turned down a move to Benfica to brighten his chances of making the 2018 FIFA World Cup squad could do nothing as NAC took a two goal lead in the first half.  Ebuehi suffered the injury in the second half, and after treatment he could not continue hence he was substituted in the 67 minute, as Thijmen Goppel came on in his place.  He is expected to undergo tests at the club on Monday, March 12 to determine the amount of time he will spend on the sidelines.  A mild groin injury could still see Ebuehi ready for the Super Eagles friendlies, while a severe injury will rule him out for up to six weeks. The Super Eagles take on Poland on Friday, March 23 and on Tuesday, March 27 play Serbia. Ebuehi has made two appearances for the Super Eagles and is yet to score a goal.
