The organizers of the premiere of the new movie “Just Before I do, set to hit cinemas from Friday, April 13, 2018 have announced that the tickets for the premiere of the movie have all been sold out. According to them, more than 1000 tickets have been sold out. Perhaps, the movie will be the first Nollywood movie to sell tickets for her premiere  in Nigeria and sell out all halls which will be used for the screening. The movie features Omowunmi Dada, Eddie Watson, Omilani Oluyinka, Chief Jide Kosoko, Kalu Ikeagwu, Shaffy Bello, Afeez Oyetoro (Saka), Judith Audu and more. While reacting to the development, the producer, Mr Omilani Oluyinka said  they were shocked that the idea of selling the premiere tickets worked. “We did not set out to make history of being the first to sell ticket and fill all halls for our premiere. It was a decision we had to take to curtail the numbers but we were shocked to realise that we now have more than the numbers we would have catered for had the premiere being made free. We are grateful to God and we hope others who cannot join the premiere will visit the cinemas immediately after the premiere to  see the movie. It is a decision they will not regret”, he said. The history making movie will have the stars of the movie present at the premiere.
