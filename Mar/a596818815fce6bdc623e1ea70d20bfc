 There was violence in Abuja on Wednesday when a fight broke between soldiers, policemen and a female Road Safety marshal. It was learnt that the soldiers and policemen were attached to the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB). The fight, according to reports, broke when a violation notice was to be served at the Road Safety office in Wuze Zone 7. In a bid to resist the delivery of the violation notice, a civilian staff of the AEPB was reported held hostage by the Road Safety marshals. It was learnt that a soldier was also wounded. The soldiers and policemen who were part of the AEPB team seized a Road Safety officer, in retaliation. This however led to pandemonium as none of the parties was willing to release the officer held hostage. The post Police, Soldiers Fight With Road Safety Officers In Abuja
