 Blankfein has led the bank for 12 years.  Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein is preparing to leave the firm as soon as the end of the year, The Wall Street Journal's Liz Hoffman and Joann Lublin reported on Friday. He's had the job for 12 years. Plans to replace Blankfein recently picked up as top board members believed his time at Goldman was nearing its end, the report said. For a replacement, the bank is reportedly considering Goldman's two co-presidents, Harvey Schwartz and David Solomon. Both men were promoted after Gary Cohn resigned in early 2017 to serve as director of the National Economic Council and President Donald Trump's top economic adviser. His exit is being coordinated to roughly coincide with Goldman's 150th anniversary in 2019. This timing is fluid and Blankfein, the report said, is in control of his departure.
