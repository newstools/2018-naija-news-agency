 Fulani herdsmen attack villagers in Ebonyi, cut off their hands and put them to death. The incident occurred in Igbeagu Community, Izzi local government area of Ebonyi. Police spokesperson in Ebonyi, Loveth Odah told newsmen that “as they attacked him, he managed to raise an alarm and more villagers came to his rescue". Odah said as the farmer’s hands were getting cut off, villagers who rushed to the scene to save their kinsman, were lacerated with machetes by the irate herdsmen. More villagers however arrived the scene, beat the herdsmen to a pulp before handing them to soldiers patrolling the community, eyewitnesses told Pulse. The wounded farmers were rushed to the Federal Teaching Hospital in Abakaliki. However, they didn’t make it alive. “One of the herdsmen later died as he was being rushed to the hospital, making it four deaths”, Odah said. Rampaging herdsmen have been blamed for a slew of killings and rustling across Nigeria in recent times. In January, Benue buried 73 victims of herdsmen attacks in one day. The northern States of Nasarawa, Plateau, Kaduna and Zamfara have also experienced varying degrees of barbaric attacks from gunmen masquerading as pastoralists. President Muhammadu Buhari has commenced a whistle-stop trip across Nigeria as he seeks to stem the bloodletting. Herdsmen: Pastoralists attack villagers in Ebonyi, cut off hands
