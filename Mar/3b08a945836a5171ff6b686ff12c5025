 Falz, who is popular for his role as Segun in "Jenifa's Diarys" is set to make his Hollywood debut in new TV series, "Church." BLK Prime, a Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) service available worldwide, has signed a multi-season deal with Falz to play the lead role in the original drama series. In the series, Falz plays Church (short for William Randolph Church), a charismatic and intense Nigerian billionaire. "I am so excited to introduce my character, Church, to the audience around the world and be part of BLK Prime's mission of offering diverse streaming entertainment worldwide," the rapper said in a statement via Instagram.  Falz is no stranger to acting. He has featured in movies such as "Couple of Days" and the award-winning "Jenifa's Diary." In 2016, he beat IK Ogbonna and Imeh Umoh Bishop to win the AMVCA Best Actor in a Comedy for his role as Segun in "Jenifa's Diary." He will be seen next in the highly anticipated movies "New Money" and "Muna."  Also an award-winning rapper, Falz currently owns an independent record label called Bahd Guys Records. Falz recently released a movie inspired by a cinematic concert, which he headlined in December 2017. It was his first ever concert and was applauded and described as a near-perfect show. "Church" will premiere on BLK Worldwide in late Spring, 2018. Falz: Rapper to make Hollywood debut in new TV series
