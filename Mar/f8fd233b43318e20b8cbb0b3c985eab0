 Photographers at Michigan's Great Lakes were in for a rare treat as bold blue ice burst into light this week.  Things are looking blue this week in Michigan. On Sunday, people near The Mackinac Bridge — which straddles Lake Michigan to the West and Lake Huron to the East — noticed huge blue hunks of frozen lake water coming ashore. It's a rare sight to see this kind of brightly colored ice in the state. Blue ice is usually seen in permanently chilly spots like Antarctica and the North Pole, as well as on other slippery glaciers around the world. As a result, some photographers were downright giddy to share their photos with Business Insider. Take a look.  Blue-hued ice came towards the shores in jagged piles, inundating a local park where people trotted out to see the oddly colorful ice.   Ice is typically white because of the tiny air bubbles that form inside the water as its freezing. You might be familiar with this if you've ever watched someone pour a beer into a glass. "The white color of bubbles at the top of a dark beer work the same way," Photographer Benjamin Drummond explains on his "Blue Ice" website. When ice is white, it's because "small pockets of air reflect and scatter visible light," he says.   As the scientists at the Alaska Satellite Facility (who see a lot of glacial blue ice) point out, the air bubbles are so consolidated in blue ice that if you put a hunk of blue ice into a glass of water, the pressurized chunk might blow up your glass.   Most blue ice shows up at the poles, but this year some compact glacier-style ice is showing up in the waters of The Great Lakes, which are the largest freshwater source on the Earth. "Only the polar ice caps contain more water," the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says.
