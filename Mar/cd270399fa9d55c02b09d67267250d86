Fellaini who is instantly recognisable with his fluffy hairstyle on the pitch, showed off an entirely different look as in the creative photo shoot Interview. The midfielder who was in action as Manchester United lost to Sevilla in a Champions League round of 16 clash, talked about his personality and style of play in the interview. Fellaini who was brought in by David Moyes, talked about his relationship with current United manager Jose Mourinho and how much he has learnt under the Portuguese coach. He said, “I've learnt a lot with him. Jose is someone who wants to win every game: he pushes players to get the maximum from them.” The midfielder also dismissed notions that he is a nasty player who only wishes to partake in the negative aspect of the game. Fellaini reiterated that there are many aspects to his game both as a creative player and a player who provides defensive stability. He said, “It think it's easy for them to portray me as an aggressive player, but I'm not, ” “I try to play my game, I try my best to recover the ball quickly: that's my job. Try to be better all the time, to give my best for the team, for the club. I always want to improve.” Felliani also hinted that the Belgian Red devils aim to impress at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. “We’re ready and want to do something special for the Belgian fans.” Felliani said. Felliani is expected to be in action when Manchester United face Brighton & Hove Albion in their FA Cup quarter final clash on Saturday, March 17.
