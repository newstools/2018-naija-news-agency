 The initiative aims to promote African women's access to the highest level of corporate decision-making. The first of these high-impact actions is the Women on Board drive, which began ahead of the AFRICA CEO FORUM with the aim of promoting African women's access to the highest level of corporate decision-making: the board of directors. The operation is being rolled out in two phases: firstly, identifying the African women leaders qualified to join boards of directors and the companies that want to "feminise" their board of directors; and secondly, to foster networking during and after the Forum. The second is having Nigeria's Folorunso Alakija, Vice-President of Famfa Oil and Africa's second richest woman, open the panel dedicated to showcasing the exceptional careers of inspiring women leaders. She will present and explain the keys to her success and her recommendations for promoting women's leadership in Africa. Last, but not least, for the 80 women lucky enough to attend, is a workshop dedicated to top-level personal development, led by consulting firm McKinsey.
