 The attackers invaded Gwaska village in  Birnin Gwari local government area of the state on Saturday, May 5, 2018. According to Channels TV, the attackers invaded Gwaska village in  Birnin Gwari local government area of the state on Saturday, May 5, 2018. They reportedly entered Kaduna from neighbouring  Zamfara State and attacked the village around 7:00 pm. Makarfi, in a statement issued by his media aide, Mukhtar Sirajo said the incident might escalate if the government does nothing about it. According to him, the security agencies have not shown that they can curb the incessant attacks. The statement obtained from Premium Times reads: “Senator Makarfi believes that government exists principally to provide security to the people; failure to rise up to this responsibility is therefore a recipe for anarchy which we can ill afford now. “Governments at all levels as well as agencies responsible must therefore restore people’s confidence by doing all it takes to not only secure the area and others so afflicted, but also ensure that the perpetrators are brought to book. “The frequency, impotence as well as impunity with which bandits raid communities in some parts of the country and leave unchallenged is a source of worry for all patriotic Nigerians.
