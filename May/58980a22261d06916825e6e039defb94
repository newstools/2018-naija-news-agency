 The story of slain mother Allison Baden-Clay will be used to urge members of Queensland’s corporate sector to act on signs of abusive and controlling relationships before it’s too late. Allison’s parents, Geoff and Priscilla Dickie, have shared their regret at not doing more to help the mother-of-three escape the abuse that led to her murder, and are encouraging others to act on warning signals. Her family say they spoke to Allison about the abuse in the years leading up to her 2012 death, but were worried about how her killer husband might react. “At the time we approached Allison and attempted to discuss her situation in the best way we knew how,” Mr Dickie said. “Allison, being a strong and determined person, didn’t want us to worry.” Allison’s body was found on a creek bank 13km from her home on April 20, 2012, 10 days after her husband Gerard reported her missing. The former real estate agent was later found guilty of killing her in what has become one of Australia’s most high profile cases of domestic violence. The Dickies and Allison’s sister, Vanessa Fowler, say the time for being a bystander to abuse is over. They are now partnering with Griffith University as part of its MATE Bystander program, aimed at teaching the business and corporate sector how to identify and intervene in abusive relationships.
