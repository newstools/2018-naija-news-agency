 Seattle Mariners manager Scott Servais rejoined the team in Detroit on Sunday after being away for two days to attend his daughter’s college graduation. Servais’ daughter, Jackie, received her Master’s degree from Ole Miss. The elder Servais said he had a 3 a.m. wake-up call Sunday to arrive in time to manage against the Tigers. Servais missed two games — a Saturday doubleheader after Friday’s single game was postponed. He felt all along he had made the right call to travel to Mississippi. “It was great to be able to go through that with your kids,” Servais told reporters. “They put so much time and effort into that. It was the right thing.” Servais caught a little bit of game action through a television and was amazed at the difference. “I will say the game looks so much easier when you are watching on TV,” Servais said. “I was like, ‘how did we miss that pitch, how did we throw that pitch?’ Everything happens way slower. Everybody needs that experience of being close to home plate or the dugout to see the speed of the ball and how much everything is moving and how many things are going on.” Manny Acta served as interim manager in Servais’ absence. Seattle also made a roster move on Sunday by optioning right-hander Casey Lawrence to Triple-A Tacoma. Lawrence has a 10.13 ERA over four relief appearances with the Mariners. The club kept right-hander Dan Altavilla on the roster after designating him as the 26th man for Saturday’s doubleheader. Altavilla is 2-2 with a 4.05 ERA in 14 appearances and pitched a scoreless ninth inning in the nightcap, a 9-5 Mariners win. “I did get to see his outing last night,” Servais said of Altavilla. “He looks healthy and the ball is coming out good and command was really good. It will be nice having him back.” The post Manager Servais Back With Mariners After Two-Day Absence  Manager Servais Back With Mariners After Two-Day Absence
