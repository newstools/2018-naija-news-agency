It’s a really fresh and unique approach, but when you look at the kit you instantly recognize PSG.”  The Parc Des Princes atmosphere reflects on the jersey with a visual effect through the use of the red stripe similar to a sound wave. Midfielder Marco Veratti stated that he was impressed with the new design for the home jersey.
