After a hard-fought 2-0 win over visiting Joliba of Mali, Enyimba are aiming to beat their next CAF Confederation Cup group C opponents CARA of Congo Brazzaville May 16, in their next fixture and consolidate on their hold on the group.  Goals in the second half by Isiaka Oladuntoye and Augustine Dimgba gave Enyimba victory over visiting Djoliba of Bamako in their Group C opener on Sunday in Calabar. Played at their adopted U. J. Esuene home ground in Calabar, the two-time African champions wasted few opportunities in a tight first half in the encounter against the Malian side. Enyimba’s trainer Paul Aigbogun has lauded his wards in face of a spirited performance by Djoliba. “We did just what we had to do to pick the three points. Those points were very important to us, and now, we can confidently look forward to our next match in Brazzaville. “We always knew Djoliba to be a strong team, considering that they eliminated MFM FC. We prepared very hard and I thank God that we got the goals that mattered,” said Paul Aigbogun, head coach of Enyimba. “Both teams were a bit nervous in the first half but we weighed up the opposition by the time we came into the second half; we changed the way we played and it worked”. CARA in the other group C game lost to Williamsville of Cote d’ Ivoire 1-0.
