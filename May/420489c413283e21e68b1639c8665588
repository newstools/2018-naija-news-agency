 The NUC boss says Nigerian needs more universities because only 19 percent of the 2 million students gained admission last year. The executive secretary of Nigeria’s National Universities Commission, Abdul Rasheed Abubakar said that the NUC was processing 292 applications from institutions that hope to become private universities. ''While many of those seeking accreditation are fairly small and specialist institutions, such as private medical schools and creative arts colleges, the new institutions will be vital in Nigeria’s plans to expand student numbers by 20 percent over the next five years'' Abubakar said.  Speaking at the annual conference of the UK’s Quality Assurance Agency,  NUC boss said there is a dire shortage of university in Nigeria. ''Only 19 percent of the 2 million students who applied to university were accepted last year, with about 30 percent either going abroad or pursuing vocational studies.

Presently, there are 163 universities in Nigeria and  if the 292 private universities are approved, Nigeria would have a total of 455 universities for a population of almost 200 million.
