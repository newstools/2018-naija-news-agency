By Alex Folorunso Engr. Segun Oni has dismissed claims that he would defect to the Social Democratic Party, SDP if he loses out in the forthcoming party primary. In an interview with Vanguard, Oni the penultimate governor of the state said:“That is not true. That is the story they have been carrying about. You should expect rumours and political propaganda at a time when the primary election is fast approaching. There are some people who have plans A, B, C and D if things don’t favour them. “As far as I am concerned, my name is Engineer Olusegun Adebayo Oni and my Plan A is APC. Plan B is APC. Plan C is APC and up to Z. My plan is APC. Why should I exercise fears when I know that by the grace of God, I will win at the primary election? “I strongly believe that APC will take over governance in Ekiti State in a matter of time. I want to appeal to our delegates to shun money bags and they should never be deceived with financial inducement during the primaries. They should vote based on their conscience and on performance index.” The post Ekiti 2018: I will not defect to SDP even if — Oni  Ekiti 2018: I will not defect to SDP even if — Oni
