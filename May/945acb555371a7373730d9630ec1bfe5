HubSpot this week rolled out platform integrations with Shopify and Workplace by Facebook, which are designed to support the marketing and sales efforts of small and mid-sized businesses. The Shopify integration, which is now live and available free of charge to shared customers in all versions of HubSpot, lets e-commerce marketers take the following actions: Sync specific merchant sales data from Shopify into HubSpot for use as a marketing signal, showing a new orders pipeline in the CRM and importing online store customers as new contacts, complete with a shopping and marketing timeline; Segment users based on products, deals and order history; then use those lists to inform emails, ads and workflows; Automate campaigns with an email workflow to welcome and onboard new customers, an abandoned cart email followup, and re-engagement email that sends special offers to customers who have been inactive. The Shopify integration also features a new e-commerce reporting dashboard that shares data on orders, new sales, lifetime value and abandoned cart recovery, and indicates the correlation between marketing efforts and revenue. The HubSpot integration with Workplace by Facebook delivers notifications from HubSpot right into Workplace, so sales reps donâ€™t have to switch between channels. These notifications are triggered by team member or lead activities within HubSpot and come with a link that brings sales reps directly into the application.
