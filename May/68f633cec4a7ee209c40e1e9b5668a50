Nigeria forward Olanrewaju Kayode was in action for Shakhtar Donetsk who were crowned Ukrainian league champions after beating visiting Veres Rivne in their penultimate league game of the season on Sunday. Kayode, who joined Shakhtar on loan from Manchester City in January, was brought on in the 78th minute of the game. The former Austria Wien star has now added the league title to the Ukrainian Cup which Shakhtar won following their 2-0 final win against Dynamo Kyiv last week. Shakhtar retained the Ukrainian league title and have now won it 11 times. In the Belgian Championship play-offs also on Sunday, Super Eagles forward Moses Simon scored the only goal which gave Gent a 1-0 home win against Anderlecht. Simon scored in the 66th minute to give Gent the win against Anderlecht who had Henry Onyekuru on the bench for 90 minutes. It was his Simon’s sixth goal in 28 league appearances this season for Gent. Gent are fourth on 11 points in the six-team Championship play-offs and will qualify for the Europa League play-offs if they finish in the position. Anderlecht are third on 12 points and will qualify for the Europa League automatic spot. And in the final day in the Scottish Premiership, Nigeria defender Efe Ambrose was in action for Hibernian who played out a thrilling 5-5 home draw against 10-man Rangers in the six-team Championship group clash to decide qualification for Europe. Ambrose was however replaced with 20 minutes remaining in the game. The draw means Hibernian finished fourth on 67 points in the final league table (their points from the regular season added to points gained in the Championship group tie), and miss out on qualification to Europa League which was secured by Rangers.
